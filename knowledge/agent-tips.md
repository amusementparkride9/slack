## Your Sales and Prospecting Playbook

### The Modern Sales Pitch: Be a Human, Not a Billboard
Forget traditional, jargon-filled sales pitches. Customers today are tired of corporate-speak. They want a real person who can solve their problem, which is usually about **price, speed, and reliability**.

Your goal is to be a relatable consultant.

### Strategic Prospecting: How to Find Customers
Smart prospecting means you know the likely solutions *before* you even engage a customer. Your most powerful tool for this is the FCC National Broadband Map.

#### Tool Spotlight: The FCC Broadband Map
This tool is the key to targeted prospecting. It allows you to research an area *before* you start looking for customers there.

* **Link:** [https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/home](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/home)

* **How to Use it for Prospecting:**
    1.  **Enter a General Location:** Don't start with a specific address. Type in a zip code (`45240`), a city (`Forest Park, OH`), or even the name of a large apartment complex.
    2.  **Analyze the Provider List:** The map will show you a list of all providers that claim to service that area. For Forest Park, you'll immediately see major players like `Spectrum` and `altafiber`.
    3.  **Identify the Best Technology:** Look at the "Technology" column. Your best selling opportunities are with `Fiber` and `Cable`. This tells you which providers offer the highest speeds and most reliable service, which are key selling points.
    4.  **Form Your Strategy:** Now you know that in Forest Park, your main pitch will be comparing Cable and Fiber options. You can now confidently enter community groups or run targeted ads with specific information.

#### Executing Your Strategy
1.  **Engage in Community Hubs:** Join the "Forest Park Neighbors" group on Facebook. When you see a post like, "My Spectrum bill just went up again, this is ridiculous!", you have a perfect entry point.
2.  **Craft the Perfect Response:**
    > "I hear you. I'm an authorized retailer for both Spectrum and altafiber in our area. Based on my research, many parts of Forest Park now have fiber access. I can check if your specific address qualifies for a new customer promo with Spectrum or see if altafiber can get you a much better deal. No harm in checking."
3.  **Use "Feeder" Ads:** Run targeted ads on platforms like Facebook Marketplace.
    * **Title:** `Great Deals on Fiber Internet in Forest Park!`
    * **Body:** `Tired of slow internet? I work with altafiber and Spectrum. Message me to see if your address qualifies for a new customer promotion.`

### The Address is Key: Getting the Info You Need
You can't get a real quote without an address. Make it the first step of your process.

**Customer:** "I need cheaper internet."

**Your Script:** "I can definitely help. The plans and promotions are specific to the service address. To see what's available, what's the full address I should check for you?"

## The Order Process: Accuracy is Everything

### Order Form Accuracy: Your Top Priority
Mistakes on the order form are the #1 reason for payment issues. Every field matters.

!()

* **Your Agent Information:** Double-check your **Agent Name** and **Agent ID** on every single form. An error here means you will **lose the commission**, even if the sale is good.
* **Customer Information:** Verify the customer's name spelling, contact info, and full address. An error here will cause the provider to reject the order, resulting in a **rejected sale**.

### Handling Customer Information
To process an order, you need key pieces of information.

* **Date of Birth (DOB):** This is **always mandatory** for identity verification and credit checks.
* **Social Security Number (SSN):** This is highly recommended for the best chance of approval without a deposit. However, if a customer is hesitant, you can enter `000-00-0000` on the form. Our back-office team will then attempt to obtain it during the final verification call.

### Provider-Specific Payment Rules
You must set the correct expectations about upfront costs.

* **Typically NO Upfront Deposit:**
    * `Frontier`
    * `Kinetic`
    * `Spectrum`
    * `Metronet`
    * *The exception:* A deposit may be required if the customer has a past-due balance or fails the identity check.
* **Requires Upfront Payment:**
    * `Earthlink`
    * `DirecTV`
