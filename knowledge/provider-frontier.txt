**Common Objections & Responses:**
- "Never heard of Frontier" → They're a major fiber provider serving millions across 25 states, formerly Verizon FiOS in many areas
- "Is fiber really better?" → Symmetrical speeds mean your uploads are as fast as downloads - perfect for video calls, cloud backups, gaming
- "Too expensive after promotional period" → Even at regular pricing, it's competitive for true fiber speeds - most cable can't match upload speeds
- "What if I have issues?" → 30-day money-back guarantee, plus free tech support and equipment replacement

**Sales Process:**
1. Verify fiber availability at their exact address (crucial - many areas still only have DSL)
2. Emphasize symmetrical speeds for work-from-home and streaming
3. Compare upload speeds to their current provider (usually much slower)
4. Highlight free installation and equipment (saves $100-200 vs other providers)
5. Use 30-day guarantee as risk-free trial

**Installation Process:**
- Professional installation included free (normally $99 value)

**VAS Opportunities:**
- Frontier Secure ($7.99/month) - Norton antivirus for all devices

**Sales Tips:**
- Lead with upload speed comparison - this is Frontier's biggest advantage
- Use speed test websites to show current vs proposed speeds
- Emphasize "future-proof" technology that won't need upgrading
- Position higher tiers for households with 4+ connected devices
- Bundle installation appointment with sale (creates urgency)

**Common Competitive Situations:**
- vs Spectrum: "Their upload is only 10-35 Mbps, yours would be 200-1000 Mbps"
- vs Xfinity: "No data caps vs Xfinity's 1.2TB limit"
- vs AT&T: "Same fiber technology, often better pricing"

**Notes:**
Frontier has been aggressively upgrading to fiber and improving service quality. Strong value proposition in fiber-available areas. Key is availability check first - many addresses still only have legacy DSL service.
