## **üéØ OBJECTION HANDLING MASTERCLASS**

### **"I'm happy with my current provider"**
- "That's great! How long have you been with them? Sometimes the promotional rates expire and people don't realize they're overpaying. Mind if I take 30 seconds to see if I can save you money?"

- "Absolutely, that's smart. While you're discussing it, let me pull up the exact pricing for your area so you have all the details. What's your ZIP code?" (Then use the form to show them real options)

### **"It's too expensive"**
- "I totally get that. Let me show you all the options in your area - sometimes there are promotions or different packages that work better." (Use pricing modals to compare)

### **"I don't trust internet companies"**
- "I hear you! That's exactly why I do this - I work with all the major providers so I can show you the real pros and cons of each one. Let's look at what's actually available in your area." (Use form to show all options)

### **"I'll call them directly"**
- "You could do that, but here's the thing - I have access to the same promotions they offer, plus I handle all the paperwork and scheduling for you. Takes 5 minutes instead of an hour on hold."
