# Agent Commission Schedule: Your Guide to Getting Paid

Welcome to the Team! This guide explains how your commission works. Our goal is to be completely transparent so you always know how you're earning and how you can earn even more. This plan is designed to make a $1,000 - $1,500+ per week income achievable for our top agents.

## Section 1: The Basics - How Your Pay is Calculated

Your weekly pay is made up of two parts: 1. Your Sales Commission and 2. Monthly Bonuses.

### What Counts as a "Sale" for the Week? (IMPORTANT)

A sale only becomes a "Commissionable Sale" after the service is installed for the customer. The date of the installation determines which weekly pay period the sale falls into.

**Example:** If you submit an order on Friday, but the customer's installation happens the following Tuesday, that sale will count towards the week that includes Tuesday, not Friday. Only installed sales are paid.

### Part 1: Your Weekly Sales Commission

This is the core of your pay. It's based on two simple things:

1. **WHAT you sell:** We group every primary internet product into four Value Tiers (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze). Higher-tier products pay you more.

2. **HOW MUCH you sell:** The more sales you make in a week (Monday-Sunday), the higher the pay rate you unlock for ALL of your sales that week. We call this our Volume Bonus.

### The Payout Matrix

Your pay rate per sale is determined by your weekly sales volume. Here are the rates for each product tier:

#### PLATINUM TIER
- **Entry Rate (1-4 Sales/Wk):** $130 per sale
- **Pro Rate (5-8 Sales/Wk):** $155 per sale
- **Elite Rate (9+ Sales/Wk):** $180 per sale

#### GOLD TIER
- **Entry Rate (1-4 Sales/Wk):** $100 per sale
- **Pro Rate (5-8 Sales/Wk):** $125 per sale
- **Elite Rate (9+ Sales/Wk):** $150 per sale

#### SILVER TIER
- **Entry Rate (1-4 Sales/Wk):** $80 per sale
- **Pro Rate (5-8 Sales/Wk):** $95 per sale
- **Elite Rate (9+ Sales/Wk):** $110 per sale

#### BRONZE TIER
- **Entry Rate (1-4 Sales/Wk):** $35 per sale
- **Pro Rate (5-8 Sales/Wk):** $45 per sale
- **Elite Rate (9+ Sales/Wk):** $60 per sale

## Section 2: Pay Schedule & Getting Paid

This section explains when you can expect to receive your commissions.

- **Pay Period:** Our weekly pay period runs from Monday to Sunday. All sales installed within that timeframe are calculated together.

- **Payment Timeline:** Agent commissions are paid out 8-10 days after the pay period ends. This means payment for a given week will typically arrive between Monday and Wednesday of the following week.

- **Why the Delay?** This schedule is necessary because we must first receive confirmation and payment from our service providers (Xfinity, Frontier, etc.) before we can issue commissions. This ensures all payments are accurate and verified.

## Section 3: Your Path to a Big Paycheck - Weekly Earning Scenarios

This section is your game plan. It shows how top agents combine high-value products with sales volume to achieve massive weekly paychecks. Let's look at what's possible.

### Scenario 1: The "Pro" Week - A Strong Start (~$700)

This is a great, achievable goal for any agent. You're making consistent sales and have unlocked the Pro Rate.

- **This Week's Sales:** 6 total (1 Platinum, 2 Gold, 3 Silver)
- **Your Volume Tier:** Pro Rate (5-8 Sales/Wk)
- **Your Payout:**
  - 1 Platinum Sale @ Pro Rate: $155
  - 2 Gold Sales @ Pro Rate: 2 x $125 = $250
  - 3 Silver Sales @ Pro Rate: 3 x $95 = $285
  - **Total Weekly Pay: $690**

### Scenario 2: The "Elite" Week - Hitting the Goal ($1,300+)

This is how you hit the income advertised in our job ads. You achieve this by focusing on selling high-value products and hitting the top volume tier.

- **This Week's Sales:** 9 total (3 Platinum, 4 Gold, 2 Silver)
- **Your Volume Tier:** Elite Rate (9+ Sales/Wk)
- **Your Payout:**
  - 3 Platinum Sales @ Elite Rate: 3 x $180 = $540
  - 4 Gold Sales @ Elite Rate: 4 x $150 = $600
  - 2 Silver Sales @ Elite Rate: 2 x $110 = $220
  - **Total Weekly Pay: $1,360**

### Scenario 3: The "Top Performer" Week - Pushing for $2,000+

This shows the true potential of our commission plan. Our top agents think in terms of monthly income, combining huge sales weeks with powerful monthly bonuses.

- **This Week's Sales:** 12 total (5 Platinum, 5 Gold, 2 Silver)
- **Your Volume Tier:** Elite Rate (9+ Sales/Wk)
- **Your Payout:**
  - 5 Platinum Sales @ Elite Rate: 5 x $180 = $900
  - 5 Gold Sales @ Elite Rate: 5 x $150 = $750
  - 2 Silver Sales @ Elite Rate: 2 x $110 = $220
  - **Total Weekly Pay: $1,870**

- **The Monthly Multiplier:** If you had a week like this and also hit a 50% VAS Attachment Rate for the month, you would earn an additional $30 bonus on 6 of those sales (50% of 12). That's an extra $180 for the week, pushing your total earnings over $2,000. This is how you can make several thousand dollars a month.

### The "VAS" Attachment Bonus
"VAS" stands for Value-Added Services (like Phone, TV, or Security). We'll give you a monthly bonus for consistently adding these to your internet sales.

- **How it works:** We calculate the percentage of your monthly sales that include a VAS. The higher your percentage, the bigger your bonus per attached order.

- **Eligible VAS:** Voice/Phone, Security/Secure, Video/TV Packages. Note: Mobile plans are excluded as they have their own flat-rate commissions.

#### Bonus Tiers:
- **Pro Attachment Rate (20% - 34%):** You earn a $10 Bonus per attached order.
- **Elite Attachment Rate (35% - 49%):** You earn a $20 Bonus per attached order.
- **Top Performer Rate (50%+):** You earn a $30 Bonus per attached order.

## Section 6: Special Commissions & Flat-Rate Products

To provide a full range of options for every customer, certain products and services have a special commission structure. These products are paid at a simple flat rate and do not count toward your weekly volume totals for the Payout Matrix. This allows us to offer everything a customer might need while ensuring compensation is clear and straightforward for these unique items.

## Section 7: The Fine Print (Important Policies)

- **Validity & Pay Period:** A sale is only considered valid and commissionable once the service is fully installed and activated for the customer. As stated in Section 1, your weekly sales volume and commissions are calculated based on the installation date, not the order submission date.

- **Chargebacks:** Our ability to pay commission is directly tied to the provider paying us. If a customer is disconnected for any reason (including non-payment, voluntary cancellation, or fraud) within the provider's chargeback window (typically the first 90 days), the provider will reverse the commission paid to our company. Consequently, the full commission amount paid to you for that sale will be reversed and deducted from your future earnings. This policy is non-negotiable.
