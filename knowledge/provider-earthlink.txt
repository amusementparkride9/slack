**Common Objections & Responses:**
- "Who is EarthLink?" → One of the original internet providers (since 1994), now partners with major networks like Verizon and AT&T
- "Seems expensive" → Price includes professional installation, equipment, and award-winning support - total value is competitive
- "Why not go direct to the network?" → EarthLink provides personalized customer service you won't get from large providers

**Sales Process:**
1. Emphasize their reputation for customer service
2. Check availability and determine underlying network (Verizon, AT&T, etc.)
3. Explain they get the network reliability with EarthLink's superior support
4. Factor in total cost including installation and equipment
5. Push VAS services for additional revenue

**Installation Process:**
- Professional installation required for all services
- Installation fees vary by network and speed
- Equipment rental ($12.95/month) is mandatory
- Schedule installation appointment during sales call

- Must explain underlying network provider and installation process

**Sales Tips:**

- Compare total first-year cost including installation vs competitors
- Target customers who value customer service over lowest price
- Use VAS services to differentiate from direct network providers
